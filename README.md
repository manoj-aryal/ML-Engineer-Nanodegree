# Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

This repository contains projects for Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program.

The course started with Software Engineering Fundamentals, Object-Oriented Programming with Python and dived into 
 Machine Learning Case Studies with Amazon SageMaker.

All the codes for the projects can be found under relevant project name.


Project Overview: 

- Build a Python Package: Write a Python package on your own using software engineering best
practices for writing production level code.

- Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model: Using SageMaker, deploy your own PyTorch sentiment
analysis model, which is trained to recognize the sentiment of movie reviews.

- Plagiarism Detector: Engineer features that can help identify cases of plagiarism in text and deploy
a trained plagiarism detection model using Amazon SageMaker.

- Capstone Project & Proposal: Complete a final project—choosing from a few, provided options or a
project of your own design—that involves data exploration and machine learning.
